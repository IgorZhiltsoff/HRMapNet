-1. Asking the supervisor if this is an OK repo, or are the Chinese fucking with me
0. Actually reading the code, no matter how hard it is
1. Debug inference and try to reverse engineering what I see

ARCHITECTURE

-1. NORMAL LINE NUMERATION

0. PERHAPS Vectorized global map downside: different number of points for different objects,
    also hard to extract local map with exact number of points 
    (FIX? store global objects as batches of local ones, each of Nv points)

Step 1 DETR


1. Understand 362-440, 484-530 in projects\mmdet3d_plugin\maptr\dense_heads\maptrv2_head.py
    +362-440 - base queries + query init !! 
    484-530 - no inference; what are references ?!
2. What are reference points?
    Where do they get them from?
    How are offsets sampled?
3. Find where the vector map at
+4. Find fusion (it is 2D-to-BEV)
+5. Can one skip the backbone and fuse images at the same time with BEV features extraction?
+5.1 How is local map embedded for attn in hrmap?
6. Check which repeated blocks share params, and which do not (for bevfusion, too)
+7. BEV history architecture ?!

Step 2
+1. Find and explain queries for decoder
    +Which queries are initialized (instance, pt, hierarchial?), and what does it mean?
        I think, instance, but must check NO ! hierarchial
    projects\mmdet3d_plugin\maptr\dense_heads\maptrv2_head.py
        +362-440 - base queries + query init !! 
    +EXPLAIN!

2. Map Encoder
    projects\mmdet3d_plugin\maptr\modules\transformer.py
        424-463

Is it hard to add wandb? Is it only config that needs altering?
